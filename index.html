  <p><b>Decentralized cryptocurrency</b> was created as a <b>solution to the problem</b> of <b>governments printing money to pay off their debts.</b></p>

  <p>When governments resort to printing money, they devalue their currency, leading to inflation which disproportionately affects 
  the most vulnerable members of society. <b>The poor are left to pick up the tab for the failings of the rich.</b></p>

  <p>In contrast, cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin, Bitcoin, Litecoin and others which are decentralized in nature,  are designed
  so that no government or central authority owns the means of printing money, which reduces the likelihood of manipulation 
  or abuse of power.</p> 

  <p>Since the advent of decentralised cryptocurrency, bad actors have used it's unregulated status to <b>scam
  unwise people out of their money</b> with promises of <b>unrealistic profits</b>. This continues today with thousands
  of <b>Tokens</b> with no utility other than to <b>redistribute wealth from the stupid to the greedy</b>.</p>

  <p>While forward thinking governments have <b>embraced crypto regulation</b> and put in place policy to <b>protect 
  their people from scams</b>, other governments — those who traditionally use monetary policy agressively against other 
  nations — are using the unregulated chaos to <b>scapegoat decentralized cryptocurrency.</b></p>

  <p>These same governments are rolling out CBDCs (Central Banking, Digital Currencies),  which greatly empower them 
  to manipulate and abuse the financial system, printing money to protect the interests of the elite, whilst <b>maintaining the status quo.</b></p>    


  <p><b>Learn the difference</b>: Decentralised crypto currencies, central banking digital currencies, and scam tokens.</p>
  
  <p>Educate yourself and campaign for fairly distributed, decentralised currencies, <b>by the people, for the people.</b></p>
